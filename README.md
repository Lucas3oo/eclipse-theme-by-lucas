# eclipse-theme-by-lucas

Eclipse inspired color theme for VSCode and Theia.

It uses "semantic highlighting" which means that some syntax coloring is done by the language server which can lead to delays in processing of the files.

Languages supported:
* Java (uses "semantic highlighting")
* JavaScript/TypeScript (uses "semantic highlighting")
* Groovy
* CSS
